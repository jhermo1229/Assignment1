# Assignment1
Assignment 1 for  PROG8145- C# Programming

There are rules to follow in coding the assignment and you cannot program it efficiently. You have to follow the following:

General Programming
6 points
The program does not have any errors or warnings produced by compilation

4 points
The program has 2-3 warnings that do not prevent it from running

2 points
The program has over three warnings or one crucial warning that influences the execution

0 points
Program has compilation errors
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Score of General Programming,/ 6Criterion score has been overridden
Running Program
6 points
The program runs without errors and produces results at the end of the execution

4 points
The program issues runtime warnings, which prevent complete proper execution

2 points
The program runs but stalls or freezes in some places. The result can still be obtained

0 points
Program stalls, completes with an error or does not run as expected
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Score of Running Program,/ 6Criterion score has been overridden
Handling Input
6 points
The program handles input properly. All prompts and data are adjacent to each other. The data is properly transferred to variables

4 points
The prompts and the data input are not adjacent to each other. in no more than 1 instance the data is NOT correctly transferred

2 points
The prompts and the data are misaligned. In 2 or more instances the data is not transferred correctly

0 points
Program does not handle input properly
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Score of Handling Input,/ 6Criterion score has been overridden
Flow controls
6 points
The program uses at least two loops and at least two 'if' statements to complete the tasks

4 points
The program uses at least one loop and at least one 'if' statement to complete the task. Some of the flow is hardcoded

2 points
The program uses flow control statements incorrectly. Most of the flow is hardcoded

0 points
The program does not use any flow controls
********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Score of Flow controls,/ 6Criterion score has been overridden
Switch and Enum
6 points
The program uses both selection and the enumeration in the proper fashion

4 points
The program uses switch statement but enumerated values are hardcoded

2 points
The program uses hardcoded enumeration values and uses other flow controls instead of switch

0 points
The program does not use any of the required features
******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Score of Switch and Enum,/ 6Criterion score has been overridden
General and non-compliance errors
5 points
Everything is compliant to the course topics

3 points
1 point
0 points
Score of General and non-compliance errors,/ 5Criterion score has been overridden
